UI Guidelines
----------

[GW2 Raidar's style guide](https://www.figma.com/file/I8c0kbP29g2phZ9n3JsOhfnp/GW2-Raidar)

You do not need an account to use the style guide as a reference but creating a Figma account will give you access to exporting assets or duplicate the file to use the prebuilt components.

CSS Quickstart
-----------

We use [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/docs/introduction) as our base framework which is compiled with our custom CSS.

[SASS](https://getuikit.com/docs/sass) is used to keep the CSS organized and easy to change. You can compile this in several ways, based on your preference and familiarity on CLI. [Codekit](https://codekitapp.com/) is the easiest way to get started but you can also use [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) or [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) if you are familiar with them.
